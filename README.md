# APSA Citation Template (MS Word)
Custom Bibliography Style for Microsoft Word for the APSA (American Political Science Association) style.

Per the Microsoft [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/word/concepts/objects-properties-methods/create-custom-bibliography-styles#see-also) anyone may create a custom citation template and efforts to locate one for the APSA have thus far failed. Thus, here is a custom one.

APSA is closely related to Chicago Style, so this style is directly adapted from that file, which (at least on my machine) was located at C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\Bibliography\Style\CHICAGO.XSL.
